# Forest_Fire_Prediction
In this study, we present the implementation of neural activation networks to a major problem of forest fire forecasting. The neural network that is used for this application is a MLP i.e. Multilayer Perceptron.We present and discuss some examples of results that demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of the emerging neural system.
We have trained our model with the help of Neural Networks using MATLAB giving it a present accurate dataset-P. Cortez and A. Morais:A Data Mining Approach to Predict Forest Fires using Meteorological Data.We have used The Fire Weather Index (FWI) which is an index based on certain meteorological features and is used worldwide to predict fire probability. It consists of different components that play major roles in causing a forest fire. The higher the FWI is, the more likely the wildfire is to occur.
